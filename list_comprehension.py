# List Comprehensions Practice #3
# To do the coding exercise below, you can choose different paths. While the correct path in programming is the one that returns the correct result, I encourage you to try applying list comprehension concepts to begin to assimilate them for the future. They can be very useful in your professional practice!

# For the following list of temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, express these same values in a new list of temperature values in degrees Celsius. The conversion between type of units is as follows:

# °C = (°F - 32) * (5/9)

# or expressed in another way:

# (degrees_fahrenheit-32)*(5/9)

# The list of temperatures is as follows:

# temperature_fahrenheit = [32, 212, 275]

# Store this new list in a variable called degrees_celsius
